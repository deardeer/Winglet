## Welcome to Homepage of Winglets

We present **Winglets** as a new technique to enhance the grouping perception in multiclass scatterplot. Winglets are designed as the two-sided strokes attached to the dots in scatterplot. With the Gestalt Principle of Closure, the global association of points can be mentally completed by those local strokes. 

Below we demonstrate the POWER of the closure effect indicated by winglets.

### Winglets 

Here on the left, we see a scatterplot with four groups of color. 
For the right two figures, we take exactly the same points, but enhance them with differently oriented Winglets.
We get a totally different visual perception of the grouping, although it is colored with four different colors.
In the middle, we see two horizontal classes and two vertical classes in the right. 

This suggests the closure principle has a stronger perceptual affect than the similarity principle.
