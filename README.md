## Welcome to Homepage of Winglets

We present **Winglets** as a new technique to enhance the grouping perception in multiclass scatterplot. Winglets are designed as the two-sided strokes attached to the dots in scatterplot. With the Gestalt Principle of Closure, the global association of points can be mentally completed by those local strokes.
